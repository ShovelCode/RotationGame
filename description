straight and right angle pipe segments directing a flow from a starting point to one or more ending points

the two types of pipes are right angles and straight pipes.

Two types of rotations: 90 degrees to the left and 90 degrees to the right.

The goal in each level could be to minimize the amount of rotations or minimize use of the left or right rotations. 

Special challenges can be made by limiting the use of the left or right rotations.
